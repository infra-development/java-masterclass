       Reserved word (53)
       In java some words are reserved word to represent some meaning or functionality
       such type of word are called reserved word.
       total reserved word ->53
       Reserved Literals(3)
       keyword(50)     |->       used keyword(48)  | if-else.....       unused keyword(2) | goto , const
       keywords for data types
       byte short int long float double boolean char
       keywords for flow control
       if else switch case default while do for break continue return // 11

       keywords for modifiers
       public, privet, protected, static, final, abstract, synchronized, native, strictfp(1.2v), transient(1.2v), volatile // 11

       keywords for exception handling
       try catch finally throw, throws assert(1.4w) // 6

       class related keyword
       class interface extends implements package import // 6

       object related keyword
       new instanceof super this // 4

       void return type keyword
       void // 1

       in java return type is mandatory if you method return anything than we how to declare that method with
       void return type
       but in c language return type is optional and default return type is int.

       unused keyword(2)
       1.goto | used of goto create a several problem in go languages enhance some people band this keyword in java
       2.const | use of final instead of const
       goto and const are unused keyword and if you are trying to use we will get compile time error

       Reserved literals(3)
       true & false |values for boolean data type
       null | default value for object reference

       enum keyword(1.5)
       we can use enum to define a group of named constant
       enum month{
            jan,feb,...,dec;
            }
       enum bear{
            KF,KO,RC,FO;
            }

       conclusion
       All 53 reserved word in java contains only lowercase alphabet symbol
       InJAVA we have only new keyword and there is no delete keyword because destruction of use less object is the
       responsibility of garbage collector

       the following are new keyword in java
       strictfp came in 1.2 version
       assert came in 1.4 version
       enum came in 1.5 version

       strictfp but not strictfp
       instanceof but not instanceof
       synchronised but not synchronised
       extend but not extend
       implements but not implements
       import but not implements
       const but not const but not implements

       which of the following list contain only java reserved word
       new,delete
       goto,constant
       break,continue,return,exit
       final,finally,finalize
       throw,throws,thrown,
       notify,notify All
       implements,extends,imports
       sizeof,instanceof,strictfp
       byte,short,int
       None of the above

       which of the following are java reserved words
       public   >
       static   >
       void     >
       main
       string   >its predefined classname
       args
       first 3
