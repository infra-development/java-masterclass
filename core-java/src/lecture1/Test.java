         Identifiers
         name in java programing used for identifiers.
         name in java program which can be concerned as identifiers.
         name in java program is called identifiers, which can be used for identification purpose.
         it can be method name or variable name, class name or label name.
        class text {
            public static void main(string args){
                int x=10;
                }
         }
         Name in java program is by default concerned as 'Identifiers'.

         I.rules for defining java identifiers
         1.the only allowed characters in java identifiers are
             a to z //small
             A to Z // capital
             0 to 9 // Digit
             $ ,_  // dollar sign and underscore
             if you're using any other characters we will get compile time error
             total_number   -> valid
             total#  ->invalid
         2.identifiers can't start's with digit
         total123 ->valid
         123total -> in valid
         3.java identifiers are case-sensitive
            java language case-sensitive
            of course java language itself is tried as case-sensitive programming language
            in java identifiers how many characters are allowed
            class text{
                int number = 10;    |
                int Number = 20;    |we can differentiate with 2 case
                int NUMBER = 30;    |
                }
        4.there is no length of limits for java identifiers,
        but it is not recommended to lengthy identifiers.
        5.we can't use reserve word as identifiers
           int x = 10;
           int if = 20;
           Next terminology
        6.all predefined java class name and interface name we can happily use as identifiers
            class Text{
                public static void main (strings[] args){
                    int strings = 888;
                    system.out.println(stings);
                    int runnable = 999;
                    system.out.println(runnable);
                    }
                }
            even those it's valid,
            but it's not good programming practice because it reduces readability and create confusion.

            Q-which of the following are valid java identifiers
            total_number //valid
            total#  //invalid
            123total  //invalid
            total123 //valid
            ca$h //valid
            _$_$_$_$_$_  //valid
            all@hands //invalid
            java2Share //valid
            Integer //valid
            Int // valid
            int // invalid
