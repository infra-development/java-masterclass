    Arrays
    IN arrays is Index collection of fixed number of homogeneous data element
    the main advantage of arrays is we can represent huge number of value
    by single variable so that the readability of code will be improved
    but the main disadvantage is fixed in size that is one's we creat an array
    there is no chance of increasing and decreasing the size based on our requirement
    hence to use of array compulsory we know the size in advance, which may not possible always
